				<h3>Interests</h3>
				<p>
					I find great joy in engaging my mind through creative pursuits like solving puzzles, and learning new skills such as playing the guitar and learning a variety of languages. To keep my body active, I enjoy a variety of physical exercises, including calisthenics and cycling for cardio, strength training with weights, and practicing yoga for flexibility and mindfulness. Additionally, I love exploring nature to satisfy my curiosity, whether it&apos;s going on exhilarating hikes to immerse myself in breathtaking landscapes, capturing the beauty of wildlife through nature photography, or simply tending to my garden and relishing in the wonders of nature&apos;s growth and serenity. This balanced approach allows me to exercise both my brain and body while nurturing my sense of wonder and exploration.
